# Hangman



### General

The classic Hangman game in the Command Prompt / Terminal.
Characters that are not letters are automatically revealed, they cannot be guessed.


### Singleplayer

Play with the computer, the computer is choosing one word of a bunch of words that are in a json file, you can add and delete words to that file, or just show the words. (**Don't cheat with that feature :D**)

### Multiplayer


One player types a word and the other has to guess it. Just as the classic hangman game.
